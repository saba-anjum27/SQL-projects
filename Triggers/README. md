## Triggers
# INTRODUCTION:
A trigger in SQL is a special type of stored procedure that is automatically executed in response to a specific event or action in a database. A trigger can be defined to execute either before or after the event that triggers it.

Triggers can be used for a variety of purposes in SQL, including:
Enforcing business rules and data integrity
Auditing and logging
Replicating Data
Cascading updates and deletes
Generating complex calculations or reports
Triggers are defined using SQL syntax and are associated with a specific table or view. The syntax for defining a trigger includes the event that triggers the trigger, the table or view that the trigger is associated with, and the code that is executed when the trigger is triggered. Triggers can be a powerful tool in SQL, but they should be used with caution as they can have a significant impact on performance and can be difficult to debug if not implemented correctly.
